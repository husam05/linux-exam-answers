## 🛠️ **Let's Fix GitHub Pages:**

### **Step 1: Manual Verification**
1. Go to: https://github.com/husam05/linux-exam-answers/settings/pages
2. Verify: Source = "Deploy from a branch"
3. Verify: Branch = "master", Folder = "/ (root)"
4. Check if there's a green checkmark or error message

### **Step 2: Force Rebuild**
If still not working, try:
1. Change source to "None"
2. Save
3. Change back to "Deploy from a branch" → "master" → "/ (root)"
4. Save

### **Step 3: Alternative Approach**
Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

## 🎯 **Quick Fix: Update Your LaTeX to Use Raw URLs**

Since raw URLs work immediately, let me update your QR codes to use them:

**Current URLs in LaTeX:** 
```
https://husam05.github.io/linux-exam-answers/?sheet=A
```

**Working URLs (Raw GitHub):**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/husam05/linux-exam-answers/master/sheet-A-answers.md
```

## 📱 **Test These URLs Right Now:**

**Sheet A Raw:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/husam05/linux-exam-answers/master/sheet-A-answers.md ✅ (Should work)

**Sheet A Pages:** https://husam05.github.io/linux-exam-answers/?sheet=A ⚠️ (Under construction)
